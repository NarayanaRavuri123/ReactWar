      "<p>3M™ Tegaderm™ Silicone Foam Dressing is an absorbent, breathable, wound dressing. It is constructed from a conformable, polyurethane foam pad, absorbent nonwoven layers, a waterproof, breathable film backing and a gentle-to-skin silicone adhesive wound contact layer. The waterproof film backing is moisture vapor permeable, prevents wound exudate strike-through and acts as a barrier to outside contamination, including bacteria and viruses.*\n</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The use of Tegaderm Silicone Foam Dressing may help prevent skin damage as part of a comprehensive pressure ulcer prevention program. The dressing may be lifted and repositioned to allow for skin assessment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>*In vitro </em>testing shows that the transparent film provides a viral barrier from viruses 27nm in diameter or larger while the dressing remains intact without leakage.</p>",
